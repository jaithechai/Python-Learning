Python and AI Learning Mini-Projects
This repository contains all of the code and learning material I have accumulated during my journey of learning Python and AI. The code is organized chronologically in folders, where each folder corresponds to a particular learning session or module. Each folder includes the code files, slides, and a README that outlines the content of that module.
